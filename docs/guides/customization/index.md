In Vue Storefront, you can fully customize the code of your project. This means that you can change the UI, integrate other services, and even add new API endpoints. 

There are a few levels of customization:

- **Customizing the UI** - the UI layer of your Vue Storefront project can be fully customized
- **Extending Vue** - add plugins and libraries that can be used to extend your project
- **Extending Nuxt** - there are hundreds of Nuxt-specific modules to add extra functionality and integrations 
- **Extending the Server Middleware** - you can extend existing integrations through our sever middleware
- **Creating custom integrations** - create integrations for platforms that we don't support using VSF Core
