# Default UI Elements

::: subheader
The theme comes with pre-built UI Elements to help you get a storefront up and running quickly.
:::

If you've seen our demo store, you've seen our default UI Elements in action. These UI elements are built using [Storefront UI](https://storefrontui.io/), a library of Vue.js components that are accessible, customizable, and easy to use.

We provide several pages and components that use Vue Storefront composables to fetch data and display a storefront.

However, you are not limited to using these UI elements. You can customize them to fit your needs or build your own UI elements from scratch.
